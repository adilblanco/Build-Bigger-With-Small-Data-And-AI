All ducks can dive, but some species are better at diving than others. The best is the long-tailed duck, also known as a oldsquaw, which can dive 240 feet.

Ducklings can understand the relationship between objects, which demonstrates abstract thought capabilities.

Ducks, like other waterfowl, have as many as 12,000 separate muscles to control their feathers. They can use these to lift or compress feathers to dive underwater, show emotion, or regulate body heat.

Ducks migrate at an altitude of 200 to 4,000 feet but are capable of reaching heights of 21,000 feet.
